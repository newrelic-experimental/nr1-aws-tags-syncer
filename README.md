# AWS Tags Syncer

An application to import AWS EC2 tags to New Relic APM services.

Add labels to apps in New Relic is a [best practice](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/guides/new-relic-apm-best-practices-guide#labels): when youâ€™ve got several different applications using the same account and each application spans multiple environments (e.g., development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard without tags. APM tags are particularly useful as well if you are using the dynamic targeting feature in alerts or workloads NR1 application.

This application will help NR users to import EC2 AWS tags to the NR APM services running in these instances. 

## Usage
Select an account from the dropdown list:

AWS tags syncer application has three main sections:

* **Filters:** useful to narrow down the scope to a specific NR account, Region, AZ or subnet. You can use also toggles filters to display only entities in sync or not in sync. Each filter accepts multi values and values are searchable by directly typing in the field.

* **Summary:** a summary to show how many EC2 instances are running with APM services, how many APM services are there, how many are in sync etc ...

* **Details:** a list of cards. Each card has the host (name, account and tags), and below, the applications running in the host (name and tags). The server icon is clickable and can open the host entity overview, the application icon is clickable and can open the service overview page. You may have one or multiple apps running in an EC2 instance (there are 2 in the example below).

In Addition to the main sections, there are few other options:

* **Actions:** a list of actions are available: Select all apps, Deselect all apps,  Sync application tags (selected ones) and show help. You can either select all apps (after filtering if needed) or you can manually select each app by clicking in the little box in the application section in each card. Then you can click on "sync you applications tags" to import AWS tags to your APM services.
